Template: console-setup/model

_Description: What is the model of your keyboard?

Template: console-setup/layout
Type: select

Default: U.S. English w/ ISO9995-3
_Description: What is the keys layout of your keyboard?

Template: console-setup/variant
Type: select
Choices: ${CHOICES}
_Description: Which variant do you have?
 The layout you selected has several variants.  Please select the one
 matching your keyboard.

Template: console-setup/dont_ask_layout
Type: note
_Description: No questions about layout will be asked
 The configuration file /etc/default/console-setup specifies keyboard
 layout and variant that are not supported by the configuration
 program.  Because of that no questions about the keyboard layout will
 be asked and your current configuration will be preserved.

Template: console-setup/fontface
Type: select
Choices: ${CHOICES}
Default: Fixed
_Description: Choose a font for the console.
 Please choose the font face you would like to use on the text-mode
 emergency Linux console.
 .
 VGA is traditionally looking, it has medium coverage of international
 scripts.  Fixed has siplistic look and has best coverage of
 international scripts.  The aim of Terminus is to reduce the
 eyes-fatigue when one has to read a lot (a note for programmers: some
 symbols look quiet similar), it supports only the Latin and the
 Cyrillic scripts.
 .
 Use TerminusBoldVGA if you prefer font size 8x14 or 8x16 and you
 don't use framebuffer.  Otherwise choose TerminusBold.

Template: console-setup/fontsize
Type: select
Choices: ${CHOICES}
Default: 16
_Description: What is your favourite font size?
 Please select the size of the font on the emergency Linux console. In case
 you use text-mode videomode the following table shows the correspondence
 between the fontsize and the number of the characters on the screen:
  size 18 - for 80x22 and 80x26
  size 16 - for 80x25 and 80x30 (most standard)
  size 15 - for 80x26 and 80x32
  size 14 - for 80x28 and 80x34
  size 13 - for 80x30 and 80x36
  size 8 - for 80x43, 80x50 and 80x60 (very unreadable).
  other size - only with framebuffer

Template: console-setup/charmap
Type: select
Choices: ${CHOICES}
Default: UTF-8
_Description: What is your encoding?

Template: console-setup/ttys
Type: string
Default: /dev/tty[1-6]
_Description: What virtual consoles do you use?
 Please enter a space delimited list of virtual consoles you use. The usual
 Unix filename wildcards are allowed (*, ? and [...]).
 .
 If you are unsure, then use the default /dev/tty[1-6], it is for six
 virtual consoles. If you use devfs, then enter /dev/vc/[1-6] instead.

Template: console-setup/toggle
Type: select
__Choices: Caps Lock, Right Alt, Right Control, Right Shift, Right Logo key, Menu key, Alt+Shift, Control+Shift, Shift+Caps Lock, Control+Alt, Both Shift keys together, Both Control keys together, Both Alt keys together, Left Alt, Left Control, Left Shift, Left Logo key, No toggling
Default: Alt+Shift
_Description: Toggling between Latin and non-Latin mode
 Since your keyboard is a non-Latin one, you will need a way to toggle
 between the Latin and the non-Latin mode.  Several options are available.
 .
 The most ergonomic choices seam to be the right Alt and the Caps Lock keys
 (in the later case use the combination Shift+Caps Lock for normal Caps
 toggle).  Another popular choice is the Alt+Shift combination; notice
 however that in this case the combination Alt+Shift (or Control+Shift if
 you choose it) will lose its usual meaning in Emacs and other programs
 using it.
 .
 Notice that on some keyboards not all listed keys are present.

Template: console-setup/switch
Type: select
__Choices: No temporary switch, Right Alt, Left Alt, Right Logo key, Left Logo key, Both Logo keys
Default: No temporary switch,
_Description: Switching temporarily between Latin and non-Latin characters
 Sometimes the keyboard is in non-Latin mode and you want to type only few
 Latin letters. In this case it may be desirable to have a key for
 temporary switching between non-Latin and Latin letters.  While this key
 is pressed in non-Latin mode the keyboard types Latin letters and in
 reverse, when the keyboard is in Latin mode and you are pressing this key
 the keyboard will type non-Latin letters.
 .
 If you don't like this feature, choose the option "No temporary switch".

Template: console-setup/altgr
Type: select
__Choices: No AltGr key, Right Alt, Right Control, Menu key, Right Logo key, Left Logo key, Both Logo keys, Left Alt
Default: Right Alt
_Description: The AltGr key
 With some of the keyboard layouts, AltGr is a modifier key used to type
 many character, primarily ones that are unusual for the language of the
 keyboard layout, such as foreign currency symbols and accented letters. 
 If a key has a third symbol on it (on the front vertical face or the
 bottom right of the key top, sometimes in a different colour), then AltGr
 is often the means of eliciting that symbol.
 .
 In the French and Spanish keyboard layouts AltGr is used extensively to
 type the accented vowels.  In the British keyboard layouts fewer symbols
 require the use of AltGr, most notably the Euro currency symbol.  AltGr is
 often used to type symbols which are commonly used by programmers and
 technical writers.

Template: console-setup/compose
Type: select
__Choices: No compose key, Right Alt, Right Logo key, Right Control, Menu key, Caps Lock
Default: No compose key
_Description: The compose key
 The compose key (known also as Multi_key) is a key which is designated to
 signal the software to interpret the next keystrokes as a combination in
 order to produce a character not found on the keyboard.
 .
 For example, typing compose, then a, then e may produce the French AE
 ligature.  Typing compose, then e, then ' can yeld an e with an acute
 accent.  Typing compose, then o, then c may produce the copyright sign. 
 Etc.
 .
 On the text console the Compose key does not work in Unicode mode. If not
 in Unicode mode, regardless of what you choose here, you can always use
 also the Alt+period combination as a Compose key.
