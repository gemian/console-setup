console-setup (1.8) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * setupcon: new option --force to skip the 'are we on the console'
    check.  To be used for d-i because there /proc/self/fd/2 points to
    pipe.  Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen from the Ubuntu team.

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Keyboard/ckbcomp: include /usr/share/X11/xkb to the list of
    directories for keyboard data.  The data from /etc/console-setup/ckb
    are still the default.
  * Sync the Keyboard/ckb data with the data in xkb-data package, version
    0.8-5.  Update ckbcomp with two new keysyms (Cyrillic_(CHE|KA)_vertbar).
  * Do not package the keyboard data.  Depend on xkb-data.  Thanks to
    Denis Barbier, closes: #359775.
  * Fix a shell syntax error in debian/config.proto that causes
    installation of console-setup to hang on powerpc.  Thanks to Colin
    Watson, closes: #374765.

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Few comments in debian/templates.
  * Document in console-setup/fontsize-fb template that non 8-pixel wide
    fonts can not be used with console-tools.  Add a warning in setupcon
    if the user tries to use such fonts with console-tools.  Thanks to
    Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.
  * debian/postinst: protect in double quotes the variables read from
    $CONFIGFILE.  Thanks to Jonas Meurer, closes: #353525.
  * ckbcomp: Do not interpret xkeysyms such as F10, F11 and F12 as
    hexadecimal numbers.  Thanks to Bálint Balogh, closes: #354564.
  * Debconf: if there are unrecognised options, do not override the value
    of XKBOPTIONS in /etc/default/console-setup.  Thanks to Javier Kohen,
    closes: #354473.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.

console-setup (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make debconf templates a bit less verbose.  Make them compliant with
    writing style recommended in the developers references.  Thanks to
    Christian Perrier for the patch, closes: #352772.

console-setup (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

    default values when executed at postinst time.  Thanks to Juhapekka
    Tolvanen, closes: #352299.

console-setup (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some bugs related to non-UTF8 modes:
    - setupcon always sets up the first console in UTF-8 mode
    - setupcon doesn't load ACM in the first console if kbd is used 
    - ckbcomp has to interpret the "acute" Xkeysym as apostrophe.
    Thanks to Norbert Preining, closes: #352449.

console-setup (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run setupcon in postinst.  Thanks to Recai Oktaş for the suggestion.
  * Setupcon uses /proc/self/fd/2 (standard error) instead of
    /proc/self/fd/0 (standard output) in order to determine whether we are
    on the console or not.  That way setupcon can detect that we are on
    the console even when it is invoked from postinst and Debconf has
    changed standard input and output.
  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
