============
INSTALLATION
============

Run "make build" and "make install".  The first of these commands will
build the package and the second command will install the necessary
data in /usr/local and /etc.

This command will install in /etc/console-setup/ckb keyboard
definitions that are more or less identical to the keyboard
definitions used by X Window.  If your system uses X Window there are
very good chances that there are already keyboard definitions in
/etc/X11/xkb or /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb.  In that case you can remove
/etc/console-setup/ckb in order to use the data proveded by X Window
and to have identical keyboard configuration on the console and in X
Window.

If you want to install the files in different places you can use a
command like this one:

   make etcdir=my_package/etc prefix=my_package/usr install

This command will install the configuration files in the directory
my_package/etc and the other files under the hierarchy my_package/usr.

In order to uninstall the package use the comand "make uninstall".


.P
You may want to make your system automatically configure the console.
In this case you should call the
.B setupcon
program during the system bootup.
.P
If you want to configure the console too early it may happen that the
.I /usr
file system is not yet mounted.  In order to overcome this obstacle
make a copy of 
.B setupcon
in
.IR /bin ,
create a directory
.I /etc/console-setup
and save all required files in it:
.in +4n
.nf

# cp `which setupcon` /bin/setupcon.bin
# mkdir /etc/console-setup
# setupcon --save-only

.fi
.in
This command will copy in the directory
.I /etc/console-setup
all required data files (font, console map and keyboard map).  Notice
that the early console configuration may not be possible if the
console utilities (such as 
.IR loadkeys " and " setfont " for Linux"
or
.IR kbdcontrol " and " vidcontrol " for FreeBSD)"
are not installed in
.IR /bin .
